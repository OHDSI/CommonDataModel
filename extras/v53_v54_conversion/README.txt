v5.3 to v5.4 CDM conversion

NOTES
-----

The *_v53_to_v54_migration.sql scripts are SQL scripts that migrate a v5.3 CDM to a v5.4 CDM.
The changes implemented are found here: http://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54Changes.html.
Please replace @cdmDatabaseSchema with your schema name.
Links to database documentation are included in each script to facilitate debugging.
