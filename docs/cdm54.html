<h1 class="title toc-ignore"><strong>OMOP CDM v5.4</strong></h1>

</div>


<p>This is the specification document for the OMOP Common Data Model,
v5.4. <strong>This is the latest version of the OMOP CDM.</strong> Each
table is represented with a high-level description and ETL conventions
that should be followed. This is continued with a discussion of each
field in each table, any conventions related to the field, and
constraints that should be followed (like primary key, foreign key,
etc). All tables should be instantiated in a CDM instance but do not
need to be populated. Similarly, fields that are not required should
exist in the CDM table but do not need to be populated. Should you have
questions please feel free to visit the <a
href="https://forums.ohdsi.org/">forums</a> or the <a
href="https://github.com/ohdsi/CommonDataModel/issues">github issue</a>
page.</p>
<div id="current-support-for-cdm-v5.4" class="section level3">
<h3>Current Support for CDM v5.4</h3>
<p>The table below details which OHDSI tools support CDM v5.4. There are
two levels of support: legacy support means that the tool supports all
tables and fields that were present in CDM v5.3 and feature support
indicates that the tool supports any new tables and fields in CDM v5.4
that were not present in CDM v5.3. A green check ✔️ indicates that the
support level for the listed tool is in place, has been tested, and
released. A warning sign ❗ indicates that the support level for the
listed tool has been initiated but has not yet been tested and released.

<p><br> * The <strong>Feature Extraction</strong> package supports all
relevant new features in CDM v5.4. For example, it was decided that,
from a methodological perspective, the EPISODE and EPISODE_EVENT tables
should not be included to define cohort covariates because the events
that make up episodes are already pulled in as potential covariates.</p>

<div id="person" class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills">person</h3>
<p><strong>Table Description</strong></p>
<p>This table serves as the central identity management for all Persons
in the database. It contains records that uniquely identify each person
or patient, and some demographic information.</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>All records in this table are independent Persons.</p>
<p><strong>ETL Conventions</strong></p>
<p>All Persons in a database needs one record in this table, unless they
fail data quality requirements specified in the ETL. Persons with no
Events should have a record nonetheless. If more than one data source
contributes Events to the database, Persons must be reconciled, if
possible, across the sources to create one single record per Person. The
content of the BIRTH_DATETIME must be equivalent to the content of
BIRTH_DAY, BIRTH_MONTH and BIRTH_YEAR.<br><br>For detailed conventions
for how to populate this table, please refer to the <a
href="https://ohdsi.github.io/Themis/person.html">THEMIS
repository</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="observation_period" class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills">observation_period</h3>
<p><strong>Table Description</strong></p>
<p>This table contains records which define spans of time during which
two conditions are expected to hold: (i) Clinical Events that happened
to the Person are recorded in the Event tables, and (ii) absence of
records indicate such Events did not occur during this span of time.</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>For each Person, one or more OBSERVATION_PERIOD records may be
present, but they will not overlap or be back to back to each other.
Events may exist outside all of the time spans of the OBSERVATION_PERIOD
records for a patient, however, absence of an Event outside these time
spans cannot be construed as evidence of absence of an Event. Incidence
or prevalence rates should only be calculated for the time of active
OBSERVATION_PERIOD records. When constructing cohorts, outside Events
can be used for inclusion criteria definition, but without any guarantee
for the performance of these criteria. Also, OBSERVATION_PERIOD records
can be as short as a single day, greatly disturbing the denominator of
any rate calculation as part of cohort characterizations. To avoid that,
apply minimal observation time as a requirement for any cohort
definition.</p>
<p><strong>ETL Conventions</strong></p>
<p>Each Person needs to have at least one OBSERVATION_PERIOD record,
which should represent time intervals with a high capture rate of
Clinical Events. Some source data have very similar concepts, such as
enrollment periods in insurance claims data. In other source data such
as most EHR systems these time spans need to be inferred under a set of
assumptions. It is the discretion of the ETL developer to define these
assumptions. In many ETL solutions the start date of the first
occurrence or the first high quality occurrence of a Clinical Event
(Condition, Drug, Procedure, Device, Measurement, Visit) is defined as
the start of the OBSERVATION_PERIOD record, and the end date of the last
occurrence of last high quality occurrence of a Clinical Event, or the
end of the database period becomes the end of the OBSERVATOIN_PERIOD for
each Person. If a Person only has a single Clinical Event the
OBSERVATION_PERIOD record can be as short as one day. Depending on these
definitions it is possible that Clinical Events fall outside the time
spans defined by OBSERVATION_PERIOD records. Family history or history
of Clinical Events generally are not used to generate OBSERVATION_PERIOD
records around the time they are referring to. Any two overlapping or
adjacent OBSERVATION_PERIOD records have to be merged into one.</p>
</div>
<div id="visit_occurrence" class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills">visit_occurrence</h3>
<p><strong>Table Description</strong></p>
<p>This table contains Events where Persons engage with the healthcare
system for a duration of time. They are often also called “Encounters”.
Visits are defined by a configuration of circumstances under which they
occur, such as (i) whether the patient comes to a healthcare
institution, the other way around, or the interaction is remote, (ii)
whether and what kind of trained medical staff is delivering the service
during the Visit, and (iii) whether the Visit is transient or for a
longer period involving a stay in bed.</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>The configuration defining the Visit are described by Concepts in the
Visit Domain, which form a hierarchical structure, but rolling up to
generally familiar Visits adopted in most healthcare systems
worldwide:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/9201">Inpatient
Visit</a>: Person visiting hospital, at a Care Site, in bed, for
duration of more than one day, with physicians and other Providers
permanently available to deliver service around the clock</li>
<li><a href="https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/9203">Emergency
Room Visit</a>: Person visiting dedicated healthcare institution for
treating emergencies, at a Care Site, within one day, with physicians

<p>The Visit duration, or ‘length of stay’, is defined as VISIT_END_DATE
- VISIT_START_DATE. For all Visits this is &lt;1 day, except Inpatient
Visits and Non-hospital institution Visits. The CDM also contains the
VISIT_DETAIL table where additional information about the Visit is
stored, for example, transfers between units during an inpatient
Visit.</p>
<p><strong>ETL Conventions</strong></p>
<p>Visits can be derived easily if the source data contain coding
systems for Place of Service or Procedures, like CPT codes for well
visits. In those cases, the codes can be looked up and mapped to a
Standard Visit Concept. Otherwise, Visit Concepts have to be identified
in the ETL process. This table will contain concepts in the Visit
domain. These concepts are arranged in a hierarchical structure to
facilitate cohort definitions by rolling up to generally familiar Visits
adopted in most healthcare systems worldwide. Visits can be adjacent to
each other, i.e. the end date of one can be identical with the start
date of the other. As a consequence, more than one-day Visits or their
descendants can be recorded for the same day. Multi-day visits must not
overlap, i.e. share days other than start and end days. It is often the
case that some logic should be written for how to define visits and how
to assign Visit_Concept_Id. For example, in US claims outpatient visits
that appear to occur within the time period of an inpatient visit can be
rolled into one with the same Visit_Occurrence_Id. In EHR data inpatient
visits that are within one day of each other may be strung together to
create one visit. It will all depend on the source data and how
encounter records should be translated to visit occurrences. Providers
can be associated with a Visit through the PROVIDER_ID field, or
indirectly through PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE records linked both to the VISIT
and PROVIDER tables.</p>

<div id="visit_detail" class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills">visit_detail</h3>
<p><strong>Table Description</strong></p>
<p>The VISIT_DETAIL table is an optional table used to represents
details of each record in the parent VISIT_OCCURRENCE table. A good
example of this would be the movement between units in a hospital during
an inpatient stay or claim lines associated with a one insurance claim.
For every record in the VISIT_OCCURRENCE table there may be 0 or more
records in the VISIT_DETAIL table with a 1:n relationship where n may be
0. The VISIT_DETAIL table is structurally very similar to
VISIT_OCCURRENCE table and belongs to the visit domain.</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>The configuration defining the Visit Detail is described by Concepts
in the Visit Domain, which form a hierarchical structure. The Visit
Detail record will have an associated to the Visit Occurrence record in
two ways: <br> 1. The Visit Detail record will have the
VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID it is associated to 2. The VISIT_DETAIL_CONCEPT_ID
will be a descendant of the VISIT_CONCEPT_ID for the Visit.</p>
<p><strong>ETL Conventions</strong></p>
<p>It is not mandatory that the VISIT_DETAIL table be filled in, but if
you find that the logic to create VISIT_OCCURRENCE records includes the
roll-up of multiple smaller records to create one picture of a Visit
then it is a good idea to use VISIT_DETAIL. In EHR data, for example, a
Person may be in the hospital but instead of one over-arching Visit
their encounters are recorded as times they interacted with a health
care provider. A Person in the hospital interacts with multiple
providers multiple times a day so the encounters must be strung together
using some heuristic (defined by the ETL) to identify the entire Visit.
In this case the encounters would be considered Visit Details and the
entire Visit would be the Visit Occurrence. In this example it is also
possible to use the Vocabulary to distinguish Visit Details from a Visit
Occurrence by setting the VISIT_CONCEPT_ID to <a
href="https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/9201">9201</a> and the
VISIT_DETAIL_CONCEPT_IDs either to 9201 or its children to indicate
where the patient was in the hospital at the time of care.</p>

<div id="condition_occurrence"
class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills">condition_occurrence</h3>
<p><strong>Table Description</strong></p>
<p>This table contains records of Events of a Person suggesting the
presence of a disease or medical condition stated as a diagnosis, a
sign, or a symptom, which is either observed by a Provider or reported
by the patient.</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>Conditions are defined by Concepts from the Condition domain, which
form a complex hierarchy. As a result, the same Person with the same
disease may have multiple Condition records, which belong to the same
hierarchical family. Most Condition records are mapped from diagnostic
codes, but recorded signs, symptoms and summary descriptions also
contribute to this table. Rule out diagnoses should not be recorded in
this table, but in reality their negating nature is not always captured
in the source data, and other precautions must be taken when when
identifying Persons who should suffer from the recorded Condition.
Record all conditions as they exist in the source data. Any decisions
about diagnosis/phenotype definitions would be done through cohort
specifications. These cohorts can be housed in the <a
href="https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm531.html#payer_plan_period">COHORT</a>
table. Conditions span a time interval from start to end, but are
typically recorded as single snapshot records with no end date. The
reason is twofold: (i) At the time of the recording the duration is not
known and later not recorded, and (ii) the Persons typically cease
interacting with the healthcare system when they feel better, which
leads to incomplete capture of resolved Conditions. The <a
href="https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm531.html#condition_era">CONDITION_ERA</a>
table addresses this issue. Family history and past diagnoses (‘history
of’) are not recorded in this table. Instead, they are listed in the <a
href="https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm531.html#observation">OBSERVATION</a>
table. Codes written in the process of establishing the diagnosis, such
as ‘question of’ of and ‘rule out’, should not represented here.
Instead, they should be recorded in the <a
href="https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm531.html#observation">OBSERVATION</a>
table, if they are used for analyses. However, this information is not
always available.</p>

the Condition Domain have to be recorded here.</p>
</div>
<div id="drug_exposure" class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills">drug_exposure</h3>
<p><strong>Table Description</strong></p>
<p>This table captures records about the exposure to a Drug ingested or
otherwise introduced into the body. A Drug is a biochemical substance
formulated in such a way that when administered to a Person it will
exert a certain biochemical effect on the metabolism. Drugs include
prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vaccines, and
large-molecule biologic therapies. Radiological devices ingested or
applied locally do not count as Drugs.</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of records in this table is to indicate an exposure to a
certain drug as best as possible. In this context a drug is defined as
an active ingredient. Drug Exposures are defined by Concepts from the
Drug domain, which form a complex hierarchy. As a result, one
DRUG_SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID may map to multiple standard concept ids if it is
a combination product. Records in this table represent prescriptions
written, prescriptions dispensed, and drugs administered by a provider
to name a few. The DRUG_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID can be used to find and filter
on these types. This table includes additional information about the
drug products, the quantity given, and route of administration.</p>
<p><strong>ETL Conventions</strong></p>
<p>Information about quantity and dose is provided in a variety of
different ways and it is important for the ETL to provide as much
information as possible from the data. Depending on the provenance of
the data fields may be captured differently i.e. quantity for drugs
administered may have a separate meaning from quantity for prescriptions
dispensed. If a patient has multiple records on the same day for the
same drug or procedures the ETL should not de-dupe them unless there is
probable reason to believe the item is a true data duplicate. Take note
on how to handle refills for prescriptions written.<br><br>For detailed

<div id="procedure_occurrence"

<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills">procedure_occurrence</h3>
<p><strong>Table Description</strong></p>
<p>This table contains records of activities or processes ordered by, or
carried out by, a healthcare provider on the patient with a diagnostic
or therapeutic purpose.</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>Lab tests are not a procedure, if something is observed with an
expected resulting amount and unit then it should be a measurement.
Phlebotomy is a procedure but so trivial that it tends to be rarely
captured. It can be assumed that there is a phlebotomy procedure
associated with many lab tests, therefore it is unnecessary to add them
as separate procedures. If the user finds the same procedure over
concurrent days, it is assumed those records are part of a procedure
lasting more than a day. This logic is in lieu of the
procedure_end_date, which will be added in a future version of the
CDM.</p>
<p><strong>ETL Conventions</strong></p>
<p>When dealing with duplicate records, the ETL must determine whether
to sum them up into one record or keep them separate. Things to consider
are: - Same Procedure - Same PROCEDURE_DATETIME - Same Visit Occurrence
or Visit Detail - Same Provider - Same Modifier for Procedures. Source
codes and source text fields mapped to Standard Concepts of the
Procedure Domain have to be recorded here.</p>
</div>
<div id="device_exposure" class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills">device_exposure</h3>
<p><strong>Table Description</strong></p>
<p>The Device domain captures information about a person’s exposure to a
foreign physical object or instrument which is used for diagnostic or
therapeutic purposes through a mechanism beyond chemical action. Devices
include implantable objects (e.g. pacemakers, stents, artificial
joints), medical equipment and supplies (e.g. bandages, crutches,
syringes), other instruments used in medical procedures (e.g. sutures,
defibrillators) and material used in clinical care (e.g. adhesives, body
material, dental material, surgical material).</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>The distinction between Devices or supplies and Procedures are
sometimes blurry, but the former are physical objects while the latter
are actions, often to apply a Device or supply.</p>

<div id="measurement" class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills">measurement</h3>
<p><strong>Table Description</strong></p>
<p>The MEASUREMENT table contains records of Measurements,
i.e. structured values (numerical or categorical) obtained through
systematic and standardized examination or testing of a Person or
Person’s sample. The MEASUREMENT table contains both orders and results
of such Measurements as laboratory tests, vital signs, quantitative
findings from pathology reports, etc. Measurements are stored as
attribute value pairs, with the attribute as the Measurement Concept and
the value representing the result. The value can be a Concept (stored in
VALUE_AS_CONCEPT), or a numerical value (VALUE_AS_NUMBER) with a Unit
(UNIT_CONCEPT_ID). The Procedure for obtaining the sample is housed in
the PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE table, though it is unnecessary to create a
PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE record for each measurement if one does not exist
in the source data. Measurements differ from Observations in that they
require a standardized test or some other activity to generate a
quantitative or qualitative result. If there is no result, it is assumed
that the lab test was conducted but the result was not captured.</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>Measurements are predominately lab tests with a few exceptions, like
blood pressure or function tests. Results are given in the form of a
value and unit combination. When investigating measurements, look for
operator_concept_ids (&lt;, &gt;, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>ETL Conventions</strong></p>
<p>Only records where the source value maps to a Concept in the
measurement domain should be included in this table. Even though each
Measurement always has a result, the fields VALUE_AS_NUMBER and
VALUE_AS_CONCEPT_ID are not mandatory as often the result is not given
in the source data. When the result is not known, the Measurement record
represents just the fact that the corresponding Measurement was carried
out, which in itself is already useful information for some use cases.
For some Measurement Concepts, the result is included in the test. For
example, ICD10 CONCEPT_ID <a
href="https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/45548980">45548980</a>
‘Abnormal level of unspecified serum enzyme’ indicates a Measurement and
the result (abnormal). In those situations, the CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP
table in addition to the ‘Maps to’ record contains a second record with
the relationship_id set to ‘Maps to value’. In this example, the ‘Maps
to’ relationship directs to <a
href="https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/4046263">4046263</a>
‘Enzyme measurement’ as well as a ‘Maps to value’ record to <a
href="https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/4135493">4135493</a>
‘Abnormal’.</p>
</div>
<div id="observation" class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills">observation</h3>
<p><strong>Table Description</strong></p>
<p>The OBSERVATION table captures clinical facts about a Person obtained
in the context of examination, questioning or a procedure. Any data that
cannot be represented by any other domains, such as social and lifestyle
facts, medical history, family history, etc. are recorded here.</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>Observations differ from Measurements in that they do not require a
standardized test or some other activity to generate clinical fact.
Typical observations are medical history, family history, the stated
need for certain treatment, social circumstances, lifestyle choices,
healthcare utilization patterns, etc. If the generation clinical facts
requires a standardized testing such as lab testing or imaging and leads
to a standardized result, the data item is recorded in the MEASUREMENT
table. If the clinical fact observed determines a sign, symptom,
diagnosis of a disease or other medical condition, it is recorded in the
CONDITION_OCCURRENCE table. Valid Observation Concepts are not enforced
to be from any domain but they must not belong to the Condition,
Procedure, Drug, Device, Specimen, or Measurement domains and they must
be Standard Concepts. <br><br>The observation table usually records the
date or datetime of when the observation was obtained, not the date of
the observation starting. For example, if the patient reports that they
had a heart attack when they were 50, the observation date or datetime
is the date of the report, the heart attack observation can have a
value_as_concept which captures how long ago the observation applied to
the patient.</p>
<p><strong>ETL Conventions</strong></p>
<p>Records whose Source Values map to any domain besides Condition,
Procedure, Drug, Specimen, Measurement or Device should be stored in the
Observation table. Observations can be stored as attribute value pairs,
with the attribute as the Observation Concept and the value representing
the clinical fact. This fact can be a Concept (stored in
VALUE_AS_CONCEPT), a numerical value (VALUE_AS_NUMBER) or a verbatim
string (VALUE_AS_STRING). Even though Observations do not have an
explicit result, the clinical fact can be stated separately from the
type of Observation in the VALUE_AS_* fields. It is recommended for
Observations that are suggestive statements of positive assertion should
have a value of ‘Yes’ (concept_id=4188539), recorded, even though the
null value is the equivalent.</p>

<p>HL7/LOINC CDO is a standard for consistent naming of documents to
support a range of use cases: retrieval, organization, display, and
exchange. It guides the creation of LOINC codes for clinical notes. CDO
annotates each document with 5 dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kind of Document</strong>: Characterizes the general
structure of the document at a macro level (e.g. Anesthesia
Consent)</li>
<li><strong>Type of Service</strong>: Characterizes the kind of service
or activity (e.g. evaluations, consultations, and summaries). The notion
of time sequence, e.g., at the beginning (admission) at the end
(discharge) is subsumed in this axis. Example: Discharge Teaching.</li>
<li><strong>Setting</strong>: Setting is an extension of CMS’s
definitions (e.g. Inpatient, Outpatient)</li>
<li><strong>Subject Matter Domain (SMD)</strong>: Characterizes the
subject matter domain of a note (e.g. Anesthesiology)</li>
<li><strong>Role</strong>: Characterizes the training or professional
level of the author of the document, but does not break down to
specialty or subspecialty (e.g. Physician) Each combination of these 5
dimensions rolls up to a unique LOINC code.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to CDO requirements, only 2 of the 5 dimensions are
required to properly annotate a document; Kind of Document and any one
of the other 4 dimensions. However, not all the permutations of the CDO

<p>The PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD table captures details of the period of time
that a Person is continuously enrolled under a specific health Plan
benefit structure from a given Payer. Each Person receiving healthcare
is typically covered by a health benefit plan, which pays for (fully or
partially), or directly provides, the care. These benefit plans are
provided by payers, such as health insurances or state or government
agencies. In each plan the details of the health benefits are defined
for the Person or her family, and the health benefit Plan might change
over time typically with increasing utilization (reaching certain cost
thresholds such as deductibles), plan availability and purchasing
choices of the Person. The unique combinations of Payer organizations,
health benefit Plans and time periods in which they are valid for a
Person are recorded in this table.</p>

DRUG_EXPOSURE, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, VISIT_OCCURRENCE, VISIT_DETAIL,
DEVICE_OCCURRENCE, OBSERVATION or MEASUREMENT.</p>
<p>Each record in the cost table account for the amount of money
transacted for the clinical event. So, the COST table may be used to
represent both receivables (charges) and payments (paid), each
transaction type represented by its COST_CONCEPT_ID. The
COST_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID field will use concepts in the Standardized
Vocabularies to designate the source (provenance) of the cost data. A
reference to the health plan information in the PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD table
is stored in the record for information used for the adjudication system
to determine the persons benefit for the clinical event.</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>When dealing with summary costs, the cost of the goods or services
the provider provides is often not known directly, but derived from the
hospital charges multiplied by an average cost-to-charge ratio.</p>
<p><strong>ETL Conventions</strong></p>
<p>One cost record is generated for each response by a payer. In a
claims databases, the payment and payment terms reported by the payer
for the goods or services billed will generate one cost record. If the
source data has payment information for more than one payer
(i.e. primary insurance and secondary insurance payment for one entity),
then a cost record is created for each reporting payer. Therefore, it is
possible for one procedure to have multiple cost records for each payer,
but typically it contains one or no record per entity. Payer
reimbursement cost records will be identified by using the PAYER_PLAN_ID
field. Drug costs are composed of ingredient cost (the amount charged by
the wholesale distributor or manufacturer), the dispensing fee (the
amount charged by the pharmacy and the sales tax).</p>

<p><strong>Table Description</strong></p>
<p>A Drug Era is defined as a span of time when the Person is assumed to
be exposed to a particular active ingredient. A Drug Era is not the same
as a Drug Exposure: Exposures are individual records corresponding to
the source when Drug was delivered to the Person, while successive
periods of Drug Exposures are combined under certain rules to produce
continuous Drug Eras. Every record in the DRUG_EXPOSURE table should be
part of a drug era based on the dates of exposure.</p>

<div id="dose_era" class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills">dose_era</h3>
<p><strong>Table Description</strong></p>
<p>A Dose Era is defined as a span of time when the Person is assumed to
be exposed to a constant dose of a specific active ingredient.</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>NA</p>
<p><strong>ETL Conventions</strong></p>
<p>Dose Eras will be derived from records in the DRUG_EXPOSURE table and
the Dose information from the DRUG_STRENGTH table using a standardized
algorithm. Dose Form information is not taken into account. So, if the
patient changes between different formulations, or different
manufacturers with the same formulation, the Dose Era is still spanning
the entire time of exposure to the Ingredient.</p>
</div>
<div id="condition_era" class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills">condition_era</h3>
<p><strong>Table Description</strong></p>
<p>A Condition Era is defined as a span of time when the Person is
assumed to have a given condition. Similar to Drug Eras, Condition Eras
are chronological periods of Condition Occurrence and every Condition
Occurrence record should be part of a Condition Era. Combining
individual Condition Occurrences into a single Condition Era serves two
purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It allows aggregation of chronic conditions that require frequent
ongoing care, instead of treating each Condition Occurrence as an
independent event.</li>
<li>It allows aggregation of multiple, closely timed doctor visits for
the same Condition to avoid double-counting the Condition Occurrences.
For example, consider a Person who visits her Primary Care Physician
(PCP) and who is referred to a specialist. At a later time, the Person
visits the specialist, who confirms the PCP’s original diagnosis and
provides the appropriate treatment to resolve the condition. These two
independent doctor visits should be aggregated into one Condition
Era.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>NA</p>
<p><strong>ETL Conventions</strong></p>
<p>Each Condition Era corresponds to one or many Condition Occurrence
records that form a continuous interval. The condition_concept_id field
contains Concepts that are identical to those of the
CONDITION_OCCURRENCE table records that make up the Condition Era. In
contrast to Drug Eras, Condition Eras are not aggregated to contain
Conditions of different hierarchical layers. The SQl Script for
generating CONDITION_ERA records can be found <a
href="https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/sqlScripts.html#condition_eras">here</a>
The Condition Era Start Date is the start date of the first Condition
Occurrence. The Condition Era End Date is the end date of the last
Condition Occurrence. Condition Eras are built with a Persistence Window
of 30 days, meaning, if no occurrence of the same condition_concept_id
happens within 30 days of any one occurrence, it will be considered the
condition_era_end_date.</p>

<p><strong>Table Description</strong></p>
<p>The EPISODE table aggregates lower-level clinical events
(VISIT_OCCURRENCE, DRUG_EXPOSURE, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, DEVICE_EXPOSURE)
into a higher-level abstraction representing clinically and analytically
relevant disease phases,outcomes and treatments. The EPISODE_EVENT table
connects qualifying clinical events (VISIT_OCCURRENCE, DRUG_EXPOSURE,
PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, DEVICE_EXPOSURE) to the appropriate EPISODE entry.
For example cancers including their development over time, their
treatment, and final resolution.</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>Valid Episode Concepts belong to the ‘Episode’ domain. For cancer
episodes please see [article], for non-cancer episodes please see

<div id="concept" class="section level3 tabset tabset-pills">
<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills">concept</h3>
<p><strong>Table Description</strong></p>
<p>The Standardized Vocabularies contains records, or Concepts, that
uniquely identify each fundamental unit of meaning used to express
clinical information in all domain tables of the CDM. Concepts are
derived from vocabularies, which represent clinical information across a
domain (e.g. conditions, drugs, procedures) through the use of codes and
associated descriptions. Some Concepts are designated Standard Concepts,
meaning these Concepts can be used as normative expressions of a
clinical entity within the OMOP Common Data Model and standardized
analytics. Each Standard Concept belongs to one Domain, which defines
the location where the Concept would be expected to occur within the
data tables of the CDM. Concepts can represent broad categories
(‘Cardiovascular disease’), detailed clinical elements (‘Myocardial
infarction of the anterolateral wall’), or modifying characteristics and
attributes that define Concepts at various levels of detail (severity of
a disease, associated morphology, etc.). Records in the Standardized
Vocabularies tables are derived from national or international
vocabularies such as SNOMED-CT, RxNorm, and LOINC, or custom OMOP
Concepts defined to cover various aspects of observational data
analysis.</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>The primary purpose of the CONCEPT table is to provide a standardized
representation of medical Concepts, allowing for consistent querying and
analysis across the healthcare databases. Users can join the CONCEPT
table with other tables in the CDM to enrich clinical data with
standardized Concept information or use the CONCEPT table as a reference
for mapping clinical data from source terminologies to Standard
Concepts.</p>

table contains a single record for each Vocabulary and includes a
descriptive name and other associated attributes for the Vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>The primary purpose of the VOCABULARY table is to provide explicit
information about specific vocabulary versions and the references to the
sources from which they are asserted. Users can identify the version of
a particular vocabulary used in the database, enabling consistency and
reproducibility in data analysis. Besides, users can check the
vocabulary release version in their CDM which refers to the
vocabulary_id = ‘None’.</p>

<h3 class="tabset tabset-pills">domain</h3>
<p><strong>Table Description</strong></p>
<p>The DOMAIN table includes a list of OMOP-defined Domains to which the
Concepts of the Standardized Vocabularies can belong. A Domain
represents a clinical definition whereby we assign matching Concepts for
the standardized fields in the CDM tables. For example, the Condition
Domain contains Concepts that describe a patient condition, and these
Concepts can only be used in the condition_concept_id field of the
CONDITION_OCCURRENCE and CONDITION_ERA tables. This reference table is
populated with a single record for each Domain, including a Domain ID
and a descriptive name for every Domain.</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>Users can leverage the DOMAIN table to explore the full spectrum of
health-related data Domains available in the Standardized Vocabularies.
Also, the information in the DOMAIN table may be used as a reference for
mapping source data to OMOP domains, facilitating data harmonization and
interoperability.</p>

<p>The CONCEPT_CLASS table includes semantic categories that reference
the source structure of each Vocabulary. Concept Classes represent
so-called horizontal (e.g. MedDRA, RxNorm) or vertical levels
(e.g. SNOMED) of the vocabulary structure. Vocabularies without any
Concept Classes, such as HCPCS, use the vocabulary_id as the Concept
Class. This reference table is populated with a single record for each
Concept Class, which includes a Concept Class ID and a fully specified
Concept Class name.</p>

<p>The CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table contains records that define
relationships between any two Concepts and the nature or type of the
relationship. This table captures various types of relationships,
including hierarchical, associative, and other semantic connections,
enabling comprehensive analysis and interpretation of clinical concepts.
Every kind of relationship is defined in the RELATIONSHIP table.</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>The CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table can be used to explore hierarchical or
attribute relationships between concepts to understand the hierarchical
structure of clinical concepts and uncover implicit connections and
associations within healthcare data. For example, users can utilize
mapping relationships (‘Maps to’) to harmonize data from different
sources and terminologies, enabling interoperability and data
integration across disparate datasets.</p>

<p>The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table is designed to simplify observational
analysis by providing the complete hierarchical relationships between
Concepts. Only direct parent-child relationships between Concepts are
stored in the CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table. To determine higher level
ancestry connections, all individual direct relationships would have to
be navigated at analysis time. The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table includes
records for all parent-child relationships, as well as
grandparent-grandchild relationships and those of any other level of
lineage. Using the CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table allows for querying for all
descendants of a hierarchical concept. For example, drug ingredients and
drug products are all descendants of a drug class ancestor.</p>

<p><strong>Table Description</strong></p>
<p>The subject of a cohort can have multiple, discrete records in the
cohort table per cohort_definition_id, subject_id, and non-overlapping
time periods. The definition of the cohort is contained within the
COHORT_DEFINITION table. It is listed as part of the RESULTS schema
because it is a table that users of the database as well as tools such
as ATLAS need to be able to write to. The CDM and Vocabulary tables are
all read-only so it is suggested that the COHORT and COHORT_DEFINTION
tables are kept in a separate schema to alleviate confusion.</p>
<p><strong>User Guide</strong></p>
<p>NA</p>
<p><strong>ETL Conventions</strong></p>
<p>Cohorts typically include patients diagnosed with a specific
condition, patients exposed to a particular drug, but can also be
Providers who have performed a specific Procedure. Cohort records must
have a Start Date and an End Date, but the End Date may be set to Start
Date or could have an applied censor date using the Observation Period
Start Date. Cohort records must contain a Subject Id, which can refer to
the Person, Provider, Visit record or Care Site though they are most
often Person Ids. The Cohort Definition will define the type of subject
through the subject concept id. A subject can belong (or not belong) to
a cohort at any moment in time. A subject can only have one record in
the cohort table for any moment of time, i.e. it is not possible for a
person to contain multiple records indicating cohort membership that are
overlapping in time</p>

table. Cohorts are a set of subjects that satisfy a given combination of
inclusion criteria for a duration of time. The COHORT_DEFINITION table
provides a standardized structure for maintaining the rules governing
the inclusion of a subject into a cohort, and can store operational
programming code to instantiate the cohort within the OMOP Common Data
Model.</p>
