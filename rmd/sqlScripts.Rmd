# **SQL Scripts**

These SQL scripts have been developed by the community to facilitate the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process from source data to the OMOP CDM. 

## **Vocabulary Mapping**

### Source to Standard

This script will create a large table containing all source codes and the Standard Concepts they map to. By creating this table ahead of time and referencing it during ETL, you can save processing time than if you were to map source codes on the fly. It is important to note that this script will show ALL mappings, not just those to Standard, Valid Concepts. Be sure to add a filter that will only grab the correct Standard, Valid codes. 

```{sql eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
SELECT c.concept_code AS SOURCE_CODE, c.concept_id AS SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID, c.concept_name AS SOURCE_CODE_DESCRIPTION, c.vocabulary_id AS SOURCE_VOCABULARY_ID, c.domain_id AS SOURCE_DOMAIN_ID, c.CONCEPT_CLASS_ID AS SOURCE_CONCEPT_CLASS_ID, c.VALID_START_DATE AS SOURCE_VALID_START_DATE, c.VALID_END_DATE AS SOURCE_VALID_END_DATE, c.INVALID_REASON AS SOURCE_INVALID_REASON, c1.concept_id AS TARGET_CONCEPT_ID, c1.concept_name AS TARGET_CONCEPT_NAME, c1.VOCABULARY_ID AS TARGET_VOCABUALRY_ID, c1.domain_id AS TARGET_DOMAIN_ID, c1.concept_class_id AS TARGET_CONCEPT_CLASS_ID, c1.INVALID_REASON AS TARGET_INVALID_REASON, c1.standard_concept AS TARGET_STANDARD_CONCEPT
       FROM CONCEPT C
             JOIN CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP CR
                        ON C.CONCEPT_ID = CR.CONCEPT_ID_1
                        AND CR.invalid_reason IS NULL
                        AND lower(cr.relationship_id) = 'maps to'
              JOIN CONCEPT C1
                        ON CR.CONCEPT_ID_2 = C1.CONCEPT_ID
                        AND C1.INVALID_REASON IS NULL
       UNION
       SELECT source_code, SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID, SOURCE_CODE_DESCRIPTION, source_vocabulary_id, c1.domain_id AS SOURCE_DOMAIN_ID, c2.CONCEPT_CLASS_ID AS SOURCE_CONCEPT_CLASS_ID, c1.VALID_START_DATE AS SOURCE_VALID_START_DATE, c1.VALID_END_DATE AS SOURCE_VALID_END_DATE, stcm.INVALID_REASON AS SOURCE_INVALID_REASON,target_concept_id, c2.CONCEPT_NAME AS TARGET_CONCEPT_NAME, target_vocabulary_id, c2.domain_id AS TARGET_DOMAIN_ID, c2.concept_class_id AS TARGET_CONCEPT_CLASS_ID, c2.INVALID_REASON AS TARGET_INVALID_REASON, c2.standard_concept AS TARGET_STANDARD_CONCEPT
       FROM source_to_concept_map stcm
              LEFT OUTER JOIN CONCEPT c1
                     ON c1.concept_id = stcm.source_concept_id
              LEFT OUTER JOIN CONCEPT c2
                     ON c2.CONCEPT_ID = stcm.target_concept_id
       WHERE stcm.INVALID_REASON IS NULL

```

### Source to Source

This script will create a large table containing all source codes and their referent Concepts. While you may be tempted to use the Source to Standard query to find these, it is important to use this one instead to populate *_SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID fields. Some source codes map to multiple Standard Concepts though they have only one source Concept. By using the Source to Standard query you may inadvertently create duplicate records in your CDM instance.  

```{sql eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
SELECT c.concept_code AS SOURCE_CODE, c.concept_id AS SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID, c.CONCEPT_NAME AS SOURCE_CODE_DESCRIPTION, c.vocabulary_id AS SOURCE_VOCABULARY_ID, c.domain_id AS SOURCE_DOMAIN_ID, c.concept_class_id AS SOURCE_CONCEPT_CLASS_ID, c.VALID_START_DATE AS SOURCE_VALID_START_DATE, c.VALID_END_DATE AS SOURCE_VALID_END_DATE, c.invalid_reason AS SOURCE_INVALID_REASON, c.concept_ID as TARGET_CONCEPT_ID, c.concept_name AS TARGET_CONCEPT_NAME, c.vocabulary_id AS TARGET_VOCABULARY_ID, c.domain_id AS TARGET_DOMAIN_ID, c.concept_class_id AS TARGET_CONCEPT_CLASS_ID, c.INVALID_REASON AS TARGET_INVALID_REASON, c.STANDARD_CONCEPT AS TARGET_STANDARD_CONCEPT
       FROM CONCEPT c
       UNION
       SELECT source_code, SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID, SOURCE_CODE_DESCRIPTION, source_vocabulary_id, c1.domain_id AS SOURCE_DOMAIN_ID, c2.CONCEPT_CLASS_ID AS SOURCE_CONCEPT_CLASS_ID, c1.VALID_START_DATE AS SOURCE_VALID_START_DATE, c1.VALID_END_DATE AS SOURCE_VALID_END_DATE,stcm.INVALID_REASON AS SOURCE_INVALID_REASON, target_concept_id, c2.CONCEPT_NAME AS TARGET_CONCEPT_NAME, target_vocabulary_id, c2.domain_id AS TARGET_DOMAIN_ID, c2.concept_class_id AS TARGET_CONCEPT_CLASS_ID, c2.INVALID_REASON AS TARGET_INVALID_REASON, c2.standard_concept AS TARGET_STANDARD_CONCEPT
       FROM source_to_concept_map stcm
              LEFT OUTER JOIN CONCEPT c1
                     ON c1.concept_id = stcm.source_concept_id
              LEFT OUTER JOIN CONCEPT c2
                     ON c2.CONCEPT_ID = stcm.target_concept_id
       WHERE stcm.INVALID_REASON IS NULL
```

## **Era Tables**

### Condition Eras

This script will insert values into the CONDITION_ERA table given that the CONDITION_OCCURRENCE table is populated. It will string together condition records that have <= 30 days between them into eras during which the Person is assumed to have the given condition. **NOTE** This query only works with 5.3 and below.

```{sql eval= FALSE, echo=TRUE}

### Drug Eras

If the DRUG_EXPOSURE table is populated this script will string together periods of time that a person is exposed to an active drug ingredient, allowing for 30 gaps in between. It will then insert the resulting era records into the DRUG_ERA table. **NOTE** This query only works with 5.3 and below.

```{sql eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

## **Example ETL Script**

### CDM_SOURCE Table

The script below is an example for how to fill in the CDM_SOURCE table. This table is required for the [Data Quality Dashboard](https://github.com/OHDSI/DataQualityDashboard) package to run. This was taken from the [ETL-Synthea](https://github.com/OHDSI/ETL-Synthea) package, a good example on how to write a complete extract-transform-load script from start to finish, including vocabulary import. 

```{sql eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
insert into @cdm_schema.cdm_source (
cdm_source_name,
cdm_source_abbreviation,
cdm_holder,
source_description,
source_documentation_reference,
cdm_etl_reference,
source_release_date,
cdm_release_date,
cdm_version,
vocabulary_version
) 
select
'Synthea synthetic health database',
'Synthea',
'OHDSI Community',
'SyntheaTM is a Synthetic Patient Population Simulator. The goal is to output synthetic, realistic (but not real), patient data and associated health records in a variety of formats.',
'https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/',
'https://github.com/OHDSI/ETL-Synthea',
getdate(), -- NB: Set this value to the day the source data was pulled
getdate(), 
'v5.3',
vocabulary_version
from @cdm_schema.vocabulary 
where vocabulary_id = 'None';
```

## **Bonus Queries**

### Visit Concept Roll-up

The query below will utilize the Visit Concept hierarcy to find the highest-level ancestors. In the case that both the VISIT_OCCURRENCE and VISIT_DETAIL tables are populated, it is good practice (though not required) to use the highest-level ancestors as the VISIT_CONCEPT_IDs in the VISIT_OCCURRENCE table and their children as the VISIT_DETAIL_CONCEPT_IDs in the VISIT_DETAIL table. This relationship between the VISIT_OCCURRENCE and VISIT_DETAIL tables allow for standardized Visit logic to be written, building Visits from Visit Details. For more information on how this can be done, please see the [Optum Extended ETL documentation](https://ohdsi.github.io/ETL-LambdaBuilder/Optum%20Clinformatics/Optum_visit_occurrence.html).

```{sql eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
SELECT concept_id, concept_name
  FROM concept 
  LEFT JOIN concept_ancestor 
 	ON concept_id=descendant_concept_id 
    AND ancestor_concept_id!=descendant_concept_id
  WHERE domain_id='Visit' 
 	AND standard_concept='S'
    AND ancestor_concept_id IS NULL
```
