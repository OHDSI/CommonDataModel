person,CDM,Yes,NA,No,NA,NA,"This table serves as the central identity management for all Persons in the database. It contains records that uniquely identify each person or patient, and some demographic information.",All records in this table are independent Persons.,"All Persons in a database needs one record in this table, unless they fail data quality requirements specified in the ETL. Persons with no Events should have a record nonetheless. If more than one data source contributes Events to the database, Persons must be reconciled, if possible, across the sources to create one single record per Person. The content of the BIRTH_DATETIME must be equivalent to the content of BIRTH_DAY, BIRTH_MONTH and BIRTH_YEAR.<br><br>For detailed conventions for how to populate this table, please refer to the [THEMIS repository](https://ohdsi.github.io/Themis/person.html)."
observation_period,CDM,Yes,NA,Yes,0,NA,"This table contains records which define spans of time during which two conditions are expected to hold: (i) Clinical Events that happened to the Person are recorded in the Event tables, and (ii) absence of records indicate such Events did not occur during this span of time.","For each Person, one or more OBSERVATION_PERIOD records may be present, but they will not overlap or be back to back to each other. Events may exist outside all of the time spans of the OBSERVATION_PERIOD records for a patient, however, absence of an Event outside these time spans cannot be construed as evidence of absence of an Event. Incidence or prevalence rates should only be calculated for the time of active OBSERVATION_PERIOD records. When constructing cohorts, outside Events can be used for inclusion criteria definition, but without any guarantee for the performance of these criteria. Also, OBSERVATION_PERIOD records can be as short as a single day, greatly disturbing the denominator of any rate calculation as part of cohort characterizations. To avoid that, apply minimal observation time as a requirement for any cohort definition.","Each Person needs to have at least one OBSERVATION_PERIOD record, which should represent time intervals with a high capture rate of Clinical Events. Some source data have very similar concepts, such as enrollment periods in insurance claims data. In other source data such as most EHR systems these time spans need to be inferred under a set of assumptions. It is the discretion of the ETL developer to define these assumptions. In many ETL solutions the start date of the first occurrence or the first high quality occurrence of a Clinical Event (Condition, Drug, Procedure, Device, Measurement, Visit) is defined as the start of the OBSERVATION_PERIOD record, and the end date of the last occurrence of last high quality occurrence of a Clinical Event, or the end of the database period becomes the end of the OBSERVATION_PERIOD for each Person. If a Person only has a single Clinical Event the OBSERVATION_PERIOD record can be as short as one day. Depending on these definitions it is possible that Clinical Events fall outside the time spans defined by OBSERVATION_PERIOD records. Family history or history of Clinical Events generally are not used to generate OBSERVATION_PERIOD records around the time they are referring to. Any two overlapping or adjacent OBSERVATION_PERIOD records have to be merged into one."
visit_occurrence,CDM,No,VISIT_,Yes,0,NA,"This table contains Events where Persons engage with the healthcare system for a duration of time. They are often also called ""Encounters"". Visits are defined by a configuration of circumstances under which they occur, such as (i) whether the patient comes to a healthcare institution, the other way around, or the interaction is remote, (ii) whether and what kind of trained medical staff is delivering the service during the Visit, and (iii) whether the Visit is transient or for a longer period involving a stay in bed.","The configuration defining the Visit are described by Concepts in the Visit Domain, which form a hierarchical structure, but rolling up to generally familiar Visits adopted in most healthcare systems worldwide:

- [Inpatient Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/9201): Person visiting hospital, at a Care Site, in bed, for duration of more than one day, with physicians and other Providers permanently available to deliver service around the clock 
- [Emergency Room Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/9203): Person visiting dedicated healthcare institution for treating emergencies, at a Care Site, within one day, with physicians and Providers permanently available to deliver service around the clock
- [Emergency Room and Inpatient Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/262): Person visiting ER followed by a subsequent Inpatient Visit, where Emergency department is part of hospital, and transition from the ER to other hospital departments is undefined
- [Non-hospital institution Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/42898160): Person visiting dedicated institution for reasons of poor health, at a Care Site, long-term or permanently, with no physician but possibly other Providers permanently available to deliver service around the clock
- [Outpatient Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/9202): Person visiting dedicated ambulatory healthcare institution, at a Care Site, within one day, without bed, with physicians or medical Providers delivering service during Visit
- [Home Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/581476): Provider visiting Person, without a Care Site, within one day, delivering service
- [Telehealth Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/5083): Patient engages with Provider through communication media
- [Pharmacy Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/581458): Person visiting pharmacy for dispensing of Drug, at a Care Site, within one day
- [Laboratory Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/32036): Patient visiting dedicated institution, at a Care Site, within one day, for the purpose of a Measurement.
- [Ambulance Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/581478): Person using transportation service for the purpose of initiating one of the other Visits, without a Care Site, within one day, potentially with Providers accompanying the Visit and delivering service
- [Case Management Visit](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/38004193): Person interacting with healthcare system, without a Care Site, within a day, with no Providers involved, for administrative purposes

The Visit duration, or 'length of stay', is defined as VISIT_END_DATE - VISIT_START_DATE. For all Visits this is <1 day, except Inpatient Visits and Non-hospital institution Visits. The CDM also contains the VISIT_DETAIL table where additional information about the Visit is stored, for example, transfers between units during an inpatient Visit.","Visits can be derived easily if the source data contain coding systems for Place of Service or Procedures, like CPT codes for well visits. In those cases, the codes can be looked up and mapped to a Standard Visit Concept. Otherwise, Visit Concepts have to be identified in the ETL process. This table will contain concepts in the Visit domain. These concepts are arranged in a hierarchical structure to facilitate cohort definitions by rolling up to generally familiar Visits adopted in most healthcare systems worldwide. Visits can be adjacent to each other, i.e. the end date of one can be identical with the start date of the other. As a consequence, more than one-day Visits or their descendants can be recorded for the same day. Multi-day visits must not overlap, i.e. share days other than start and end days. It is often the case that some logic should be written for how to define visits and how to assign Visit_Concept_Id. For example, in US claims outpatient visits that appear to occur within the time period of an inpatient visit can be rolled into one with the same Visit_Occurrence_Id. In EHR data inpatient visits that are within one day of each other may be strung together to create one visit. It will all depend on the source data and how encounter records should be translated to visit occurrences. Providers can be associated with a Visit through the PROVIDER_ID field, or indirectly through PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE records linked both to the VISIT and PROVIDER tables."
visit_detail,CDM,No,VISIT_DETAIL_,Yes,0,NA,The VISIT_DETAIL table is an optional table used to represents details of each record in the parent VISIT_OCCURRENCE table. A good example of this would be the movement between units in a hospital during an inpatient stay or claim lines associated with a one insurance claim. For every record in the VISIT_OCCURRENCE table there may be 0 or more records in the VISIT_DETAIL table with a 1:n relationship where n may be 0. The VISIT_DETAIL table is structurally very similar to VISIT_OCCURRENCE table and belongs to the visit domain.,"The configuration defining the Visit Detail is described by Concepts in the Visit Domain, which form a hierarchical structure. The Visit Detail record will have an associated to the Visit Occurrence record in two ways: <br> 1. The Visit Detail record will have the VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID it is associated to 2. The VISIT_DETAIL_CONCEPT_ID  will be a descendant of the VISIT_CONCEPT_ID for the Visit.","It is not mandatory that the VISIT_DETAIL table be filled in, but if you find that the logic to create VISIT_OCCURRENCE records includes the roll-up of multiple smaller records to create one picture of a Visit then it is a good idea to use VISIT_DETAIL. In EHR data, for example, a Person may be in the hospital but instead of one over-arching Visit their encounters are recorded as times they interacted with a health care provider. A Person in the hospital interacts with multiple providers multiple times a day so the encounters must be strung together using some heuristic (defined by the ETL) to identify the entire Visit. In this case the encounters would be considered Visit Details and the entire Visit would be the Visit Occurrence. In this example it is also possible to use the Vocabulary to distinguish Visit Details from a Visit Occurrence by setting the VISIT_CONCEPT_ID to [9201](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/9201) and the VISIT_DETAIL_CONCEPT_IDs either to 9201 or its children to indicate where the patient was in the hospital at the time of care."
condition_occurrence,CDM,No,CONDITION_,Yes,0,NA,"This table contains records of Events of a Person suggesting the presence of a disease or medical condition stated as a diagnosis, a sign, or a symptom, which is either observed by a Provider or reported by the patient.","Conditions are defined by Concepts from the Condition domain, which form a complex hierarchy. As a result, the same Person with the same disease may have multiple Condition records, which belong to the same hierarchical family. Most Condition records are mapped from diagnostic codes, but recorded signs, symptoms and summary descriptions also contribute to this table. Rule out diagnoses should not be recorded in this table, but in reality their negating nature is not always captured in the source data, and other precautions must be taken when when identifying Persons who should suffer from the recorded Condition. Record all conditions as they exist in the source data. Any decisions about diagnosis/phenotype definitions would be done through cohort specifications. These cohorts can be housed in the [COHORT](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#payer_plan_period) table. Conditions span a time interval from start to end, but are typically recorded as single snapshot records with no end date. The reason is twofold: (i) At the time of the recording the duration is not known and later not recorded, and (ii) the Persons typically cease interacting with the healthcare system when they feel better, which leads to incomplete capture of resolved Conditions. The [CONDITION_ERA](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#condition_era) table addresses this issue. Family history and past diagnoses ('history of') are not recorded in this table. Instead, they are listed in the [OBSERVATION](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#observation) table. Codes written in the process of establishing the diagnosis, such as 'question of' of and 'rule out', should not represented here. Instead, they should be recorded in the [OBSERVATION](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#observation) table, if they are used for analyses. However, this information is not always available.",Source codes and source text fields mapped to Standard Concepts of the Condition Domain have to be recorded here.
drug_exposure,CDM,No,DRUG_,Yes,0,NA,"This table captures records about the exposure to a Drug ingested or otherwise introduced into the body. A Drug is a biochemical substance formulated in such a way that when administered to a Person it will exert a certain biochemical effect on the metabolism. Drugs include prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vaccines, and large-molecule biologic therapies. Radiological devices ingested or applied locally do not count as Drugs.","The purpose of records in this table is to indicate an exposure to a certain drug as best as possible. In this context a drug is defined as an active ingredient. Drug Exposures are defined by Concepts from the Drug domain, which form a complex hierarchy. As a result, one DRUG_SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID may map to multiple standard concept ids if it is a combination product. Records in this table represent prescriptions written, prescriptions dispensed, and drugs administered by a provider to name a few. The DRUG_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID can be used to find and filter on these types. This table includes additional information about the drug products, the quantity given, and route of administration.","Information about quantity and dose is provided in a variety of different ways and it is important for the ETL to provide as much information as possible from the data. Depending on the provenance of the data fields may be captured differently i.e. quantity for drugs administered may have a separate meaning from quantity for prescriptions dispensed. If a patient has multiple records on the same day for the same drug or procedures the ETL should not de-dupe them unless there is probable reason to believe the item is a true data duplicate. Take note on how to handle refills for prescriptions written.<br><br>For detailed conventions on how to populate this table, please refer to the [THEMIS repository](https://ohdsi.github.io/Themis/drug_exposure.html)."
procedure_occurrence,CDM,No,PROCEDURE_,Yes,0,NA,"This table contains records of activities or processes ordered by, or carried out by, a healthcare provider on the patient with a diagnostic or therapeutic purpose.","Lab tests are not a procedure, if something is observed with an expected resulting amount and unit then it should be a measurement. Phlebotomy is a procedure but so trivial that it tends to be rarely captured. It can be assumed that there is a phlebotomy procedure associated with many lab tests, therefore it is unnecessary to add them as separate procedures.","When dealing with duplicate records, the ETL must determine whether to sum them up into one record or keep them separate. Things to consider are: 

- Same Procedure 
- Same procedure_datetime
- Same Visit Occurrence or Visit Detail 
- Same Provider 
- Same Modifier for Procedures.

device_exposure,CDM,No,DEVICE_,Yes,0,NA,"The Device domain captures information about a person's exposure to a foreign physical object or instrument which is used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes through a mechanism beyond chemical action. Devices include implantable objects (e.g. pacemakers, stents, artificial joints), medical equipment and supplies (e.g. bandages, crutches, syringes), other instruments used in medical procedures (e.g. sutures, defibrillators) and material used in clinical care (e.g. adhesives, body material, dental material, surgical material).","The distinction between Devices or supplies and Procedures are sometimes blurry, but the former are physical objects while the latter are actions, often to apply a Device or supply.",Source codes and source text fields mapped to Standard Concepts of the Device Domain have to be recorded here.
measurement,CDM,No,MEASUREMENT_,Yes,0,NA,"The MEASUREMENT table contains records of Measurements, i.e. structured values (numerical or categorical) obtained through systematic and standardized examination or testing of a Person or Person's sample. The MEASUREMENT table contains both orders and results of such Measurements as laboratory tests, vital signs, quantitative findings from pathology reports, etc. Measurements are stored as attribute value pairs, with the attribute as the Measurement Concept and the value representing the result. The value can be a Concept (stored in VALUE_AS_CONCEPT), or a numerical value (VALUE_AS_NUMBER) with a Unit (UNIT_CONCEPT_ID). The Procedure for obtaining the sample is housed in the PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE table, though it is unnecessary to create a PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE record for each measurement if one does not exist in the source data. Measurements differ from Observations in that they require a standardized test or some other activity to generate a quantitative or qualitative result. If there is no result, it is assumed that the lab test was conducted but the result was not captured.","Measurements are predominately lab tests with a few exceptions, like blood pressure or function tests. Results are given in the form of a value and unit combination. When investigating measurements, look for operator_concept_ids (<, >, etc.).","Only records where the source value maps to a Concept in the measurement domain should be included in this table. Even though each Measurement always has a result, the fields VALUE_AS_NUMBER and VALUE_AS_CONCEPT_ID are not mandatory as often the result is not given in the source data. When the result is not known, the Measurement record represents just the fact that the corresponding Measurement was carried out, which in itself is already useful information for some use cases. For some Measurement Concepts, the result is included in the test. For example, ICD10 CONCEPT_ID [45548980](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/45548980) 'Abnormal level of unspecified serum enzyme' indicates a Measurement and the result (abnormal). In those situations, the CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table in addition to the 'Maps to' record contains a second record with the relationship_id set to 'Maps to value'. In this example, the 'Maps to' relationship directs to [4046263](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/4046263) 'Enzyme measurement' as well as a 'Maps to value' record to [4135493](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/4135493) 'Abnormal'."
observation,CDM,No,OBSERVATION_,Yes,0,NA,"The OBSERVATION table captures clinical facts about a Person obtained in the context of examination, questioning or a procedure. Any data that cannot be represented by any other domains, such as social and lifestyle facts, medical history, family history, etc. are recorded here.","Observations differ from Measurements in that they do not require a standardized test or some other activity to generate clinical fact. Typical observations are medical history, family history, the stated need for certain treatment, social circumstances, lifestyle choices, healthcare utilization patterns, etc. If the generation clinical facts requires a standardized testing such as lab testing or imaging and leads to a standardized result, the data item is recorded in the MEASUREMENT table. If the clinical fact observed determines a sign, symptom, diagnosis of a disease or other medical condition, it is recorded in the CONDITION_OCCURRENCE table. Valid Observation Concepts are not enforced to be from any domain but they must not belong to the Condition, Procedure, Drug, Device, Specimen, or Measurement domains and they must be Standard Concepts. <br><br>The observation table usually records the date or datetime of when the observation was obtained, not the date of the observation starting. For example, if the patient reports that they had a heart attack when they were 50, the observation date or datetime is the date of the report, the heart attack observation can have a value_as_concept which captures how long ago the observation applied to the patient.","Records whose Source Values map to any domain besides Condition, Procedure, Drug, Specimen, Measurement or Device should be stored in the Observation table. Observations can be stored as attribute value pairs, with the attribute as the Observation Concept and the value representing the clinical fact. This fact can be a Concept (stored in VALUE_AS_CONCEPT), a numerical value (VALUE_AS_NUMBER) or a verbatim string (VALUE_AS_STRING). Even though Observations do not have an explicit result, the clinical fact can be stated separately from the type of Observation in the VALUE_AS_* fields. It is recommended for Observations that are suggestive statements of positive assertion should have a value of 'Yes' (concept_id=4188539), recorded, even though the null value is the equivalent."
death,CDM,No,NA,No,NA,NA,"The death domain contains the clinical event for how and when a Person dies.

It guides the creation of LOINC codes for clinical notes. CDO annotates each document with 5 dimensions:

- **Kind of Document**: Characterizes the general structure of the document at a macro level (e.g. Anesthesia Consent)
- **Type of Service**: Characterizes the kind of service or activity (e.g. evaluations, consultations, and summaries). The notion of time sequence, e.g., at the beginning (admission) at the end (discharge) is subsumed in this axis. Example: Discharge Teaching.
- **Setting**: Setting is an extension of CMS's definitions (e.g. Inpatient, Outpatient)
- **Subject Matter Domain (SMD)**: Characterizes the subject matter domain of a note (e.g. Anesthesiology)
- **Role**: Characterizes the training or professional level of the author of the document, but does not break down to specialty or subspecialty (e.g. Physician)
Each combination of these 5 dimensions rolls up to a unique LOINC code.

According to CDO requirements, only 2 of the 5 dimensions are required to properly annotate a document; Kind of Document and any one of the other 4 dimensions.

These benefit plans are provided by payers, such as health insurances or state or government agencies. In each plan the details of the health benefits are defined for the Person or her family, and the health benefit Plan might change over time typically with increasing utilization (reaching certain cost thresholds such as deductibles), plan availability and purchasing choices of the Person.

- It allows aggregation of chronic conditions that require frequent ongoing care, instead of treating each Condition Occurrence as an independent event.
- It allows aggregation of multiple, closely timed doctor visits for the same Condition to avoid double-counting the Condition Occurrences.
For example, consider a Person who visits her Primary Care Physician (PCP) and who is referred to a specialist.

Each Standard Concept belongs to one Domain, which defines the location where the Concept would be expected to occur within the data tables of the CDM. Concepts can represent broad categories ('Cardiovascular disease'), detailed clinical elements ('Myocardial infarction of the anterolateral wall'), or modifying characteristics and attributes that define Concepts at various levels of detail (severity of a disease, associated morphology, etc.). Records in the Standardized Vocabularies tables are derived from national or international vocabularies such as SNOMED-CT, RxNorm, and LOINC, or custom OMOP Concepts defined to cover various aspects of observational data analysis.","The primary purpose of the CONCEPT table is to provide a standardized representation of medical Concepts, allowing for consistent querying and analysis across the healthcare databases. Users can join the CONCEPT table with other tables in the CDM to enrich clinical data with standardized Concept information or use the CONCEPT table as a reference for mapping clinical data from source terminologies to Standard Concepts.",NA
vocabulary,VOCAB,No,NA,No,NA,NA,The VOCABULARY table includes a list of the Vocabularies integrated from various sources or created de novo in OMOP CDM. This reference table contains a single record for each Vocabulary and includes a descriptive name and other associated attributes for the Vocabulary.,"The primary purpose of the VOCABULARY table is to provide explicit information about specific vocabulary versions and the references to the sources from which they are asserted. Users can identify the version of a particular vocabulary used in the database, enabling consistency and reproducibility in data analysis. Besides, users can check the vocabulary release version in their CDM which refers to the vocabulary_id = 'None'.",NA
domain,VOCAB,No,NA,No,NA,NA,"The DOMAIN table includes a list of OMOP-defined Domains to which the Concepts of the Standardized Vocabularies can belong. A Domain represents a clinical definition whereby we assign matching Concepts for the standardized fields in the CDM tables. For example, the Condition Domain contains Concepts that describe a patient condition, and these Concepts can only be used in the condition_concept_id field of the CONDITION_OCCURRENCE and CONDITION_ERA tables. This reference table is populated with a single record for each Domain, including a Domain ID and a descriptive name for every Domain.","Users can leverage the DOMAIN table to explore the full spectrum of health-related data Domains available in the Standardized Vocabularies. Also, the information in the DOMAIN table may be used as a reference for mapping source data to OMOP domains, facilitating data harmonization and interoperability.",NA
concept_class,VOCAB,No,NA,No,NA,NA,"The CONCEPT_CLASS table includes semantic categories that reference the source structure of each Vocabulary. Concept Classes represent so-called horizontal (e.g. MedDRA, RxNorm) or vertical levels (e.g. SNOMED) of the vocabulary structure. Vocabularies without any Concept Classes, such as HCPCS, use the vocabulary_id as the Concept Class. This reference table is populated with a single record for each Concept Class, which includes a Concept Class ID and a fully specified Concept Class name.
",Users can utilize the CONCEPT_CLASS table to explore the different classes or categories of concepts within the OHDSI vocabularies.,NA
concept_relationship,VOCAB,No,NA,No,NA,NA,"The CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table contains records that define relationships between any two Concepts and the nature or type of the relationship. This table captures various types of relationships, including hierarchical, associative, and other semantic connections, enabling comprehensive analysis and interpretation of clinical concepts. Every kind of relationship is defined in the RELATIONSHIP table.","The CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table can be used to explore hierarchical or attribute relationships between concepts to understand the hierarchical structure of clinical concepts and uncover implicit connections and associations within healthcare data. For example, users can utilize mapping relationships ('Maps to') to harmonize data from different sources and terminologies, enabling interoperability and data integration across disparate datasets.",NA
relationship,VOCAB,No,NA,No,NA,NA,"The RELATIONSHIP table provides a reference list of all types of relationships that can be used to associate any two Concepts in the CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table, the respective reverse relationships, and their hierarchical characteristics. Note, that Concepts representing relationships between the clinical facts, used for filling in the FACT_RELATIONSHIP table are stored in the CONCEPT table and belong to the Relationship Domain.","Users can leverage the RELATIONSHIP table to explore the full list of direct and reverse relationships within the OMOP vocabulary system. Also, users can get insight into how these relationships can be used in ETL, cohort creation, and other tasks according to their ancestral characteristics.",NA
concept_synonym,VOCAB,No,NA,No,NA,NA,"The CONCEPT_SYNONYM table captures alternative terms, synonyms, and translations of Concept Name into various languages linked to specific concepts, providing users with a comprehensive view of how Concepts may be expressed or referenced.","Users can leverage the CONCEPT_SYNONYM table to expand search capabilities and improve query accuracy by incorporating synonymous terms into data analysis and retrieval processes. Also, users can enhance their mapping efforts between local terminologies and standardized concepts by identifying synonymous terms associated with concepts in the CONCEPT_SYNONYM table.",NA
concept_ancestor,VOCAB,No,NA,No,NA,NA,"The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table is designed to simplify observational analysis by providing the complete hierarchical relationships between Concepts. Only direct parent-child relationships between Concepts are stored in the CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table. To determine higher-level ancestry connections, all individual direct relationships would have to be navigated at analysis time. The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table includes records for all parent-child relationships, as well as grandparent-grandchild relationships and those of any other level of lineage for Standard or Classification concepts. Using the CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table allows for querying for all descendants of a hierarchical concept, and the other way around. For example, drug ingredients and drug products, beneath them in the hierarchy, are all descendants of a drug class ancestor. This table is entirely derived from the CONCEPT, CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP, and RELATIONSHIP tables.","The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table can be used to explore the hierarchical relationships captured in the table to gain insights into the hierarchical structure of clinical concepts. Understanding the hierarchical relationships of concepts can facilitate accurate interpretation and analysis of healthcare data. Also, by incorporating hierarchical relationships from the CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table, users can create cohorts containing related concepts within a hierarchical structure, enabling more comprehensive cohort definitions.",NA
source_to_concept_map,VOCAB,No,NA,No,NA,NA,"The source to concept map table is recommended for use in ETL processes to maintain local source codes which are not available as Concepts in the Standardized Vocabularies, and to establish mappings for each source code into a Standard Concept as target_concept_ids that can be used to populate the Common Data Model tables. The SOURCE_TO_CONCEPT_MAP table is no longer populated with content within the Standardized Vocabularies published to the OMOP community. **There are OHDSI tools to help you populate this table; [Usagi](https://github.com/OHDSI/Usagi) and [Perseus](https://github.com/ohdsi/Perseus).

cohort,RESULTS,No,NA,No,NA,NA,"The subject of a cohort can have multiple, discrete records in the cohort table per cohort_definition_id, subject_id, and non-overlapping time periods. The definition of the cohort is contained within the COHORT_DEFINITION table. It is listed as part of the RESULTS schema because it is a table that users of the database as well as tools such as ATLAS need to be able to write to. The CDM and Vocabulary tables are all read-only so it is suggested that the COHORT and COHORT_DEFINTION tables are kept in a separate schema to alleviate confusion.",NA,"Cohorts typically include patients diagnosed with a specific condition, patients exposed to a particular drug, but can also be Providers who have performed a specific Procedure. Cohort records must have a Start Date and an End Date, but the End Date may be set to Start Date or could have an applied censor date using the Observation Period Start Date. Cohort records must contain a Subject Id, which can refer to the Person, Provider, Visit record or Care Site though they are most often Person Ids. The Cohort Definition will define the type of subject through the subject concept id. A subject can belong (or not belong) to a cohort at any moment in time. A subject can only have one record in the cohort table for any moment of time, i.e. it is not possible for a person to contain multiple records indicating cohort membership that are overlapping in time"
cohort_definition,RESULTS,No,NA,No,NA,NA,"The COHORT_DEFINITION table contains records defining a Cohort derived from the data through the associated description and syntax and upon instantiation (execution of the algorithm) placed into the COHORT table. Cohorts are a set of subjects that satisfy a given combination of inclusion criteria for a duration of time. The COHORT_DEFINITION table provides a standardized structure for maintaining the rules governing the inclusion of a subject into a cohort, and can store operational programming code to instantiate the cohort within the OMOP Common Data Model.",NA,NA
