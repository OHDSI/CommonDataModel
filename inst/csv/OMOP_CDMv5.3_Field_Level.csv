This information is relevant in the context of quantity and administration information in the subsequent fields plus strength information from the DRUG_STRENGTH table, provided as part of the standard vocabulary download.","The CONCEPT_ID that the DRUG_SOURCE_VALUE maps to. The concept id should be derived either from mapping from the source concept id or by picking the drug concept representing the most amount of detail you have. Records whose source values map to standard concepts with a domain of Drug should go in this table. When the Drug Source Value of the code cannot be translated into Standard Drug Concept IDs, a Drug exposure entry is stored with only the corresponding SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID and DRUG_SOURCE_VALUE and a DRUG_CONCEPT_ID of 0. The Drug Concept with the most detailed content of information is preferred during the mapping process. These are indicated in the CONCEPT_CLASS_ID field of the Concept and are recorded in the following order of precedence: 'Branded Pack', 'Clinical Pack', 'Branded Drug', 'Clinical Drug', 'Branded Drug Component', 'Clinical Drug Component', 'Branded Drug Form', 'Clinical Drug Form', and only if no other information is available 'Ingredient'.

Use quantity divided by daily dose that you may obtain from the sig or a source field (or assumed daily dose of 1) for solid, indivisibile, drug products. If quantity represents ingredient amount, quantity divided by daily dose * concentration (from drug_strength) drug concept id tells you the dose form. 3.

Clinical drugs with divisible dose forms (injections) the quantity is the amount of ingredient the patient got. For example, if the injection is 2mg/mL but the patient got 80mL then quantity is reported as 160.

In OMOP the Vocabulary breaks these two clinical ideas into two codes; one becomes the OBSERVATION_CONCEPT_ID and the other becomes the VALUE_AS_CONCEPT_ID. It is important when using the Observation table to keep this possibility in mind and to examine the VALUE_AS_CONCEPT_ID field for relevant information. ","Note that the value of VALUE_AS_CONCEPT_ID may be provided through mapping from a source Concept which contains the content of the Observation. In those situations, the CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table in addition to the 'Maps to' record contains a second record with the relationship_id set to 'Maps to value'. For example, ICD10 [Z82.4](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/45581076) 'Family history of ischaemic heart disease and other diseases of the circulatory system' has a 'Maps to' relationship to [4167217](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/4167217) 'Family history of clinical finding' as well as a 'Maps to value' record to [134057](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/134057) 'Disorder of cardiovascular system'.",No,Yes,CONCEPT,CONCEPT_ID,,,
